      "methodology_notes": "The research methodology described in the paper focuses on a novel algorithm for 3D acetabulum reconstruction using embedded deformation (ED) and square-root velocity function (SRVF) based non-rigid registration. The approach leverages mathematical models and optimization techniques rather than machine learning models, hence it does not require training. However, it does require datasets for validation, specifically 3D models and X-ray images for both simulated and real patient data. The methodology involves several algorithmic steps, including the calculation of 2D-3D correspondences, optimization of deformation parameters, and validation against ground truth data. The reproducibility of this research depends on the availability of the datasets and the implementation of the described algorithms. The paper provides detailed descriptions of the mathematical formulations and optimization strategies used, which are essential for reproducing the results. The code documentation supports the methodology by detailing the implementation of key functions used in the algorithm, such as correspondence calculation and deformation optimization."

The code files provided do not include any scripts or functions that indicate dataset splitting or the use of specific data partitions. Additionally, there is no documentation of random seeds being used to ensure replicability of the experiments. This lack of information on dataset splits and random seeds makes it challenging to replicate the study's results accurately."
